## 1.2 Listening Strategy

### *Before the exam: Go through the questions*

1. First, highlight key words in the question. What kind of information are they asking for (nouns, verbs, person, facts, opinions, reasons, feelings)? This allows you to know what content you should be looking for during the audio.  
2. Based on the questions, predict the possible answers.  
3. Pay attention to clues (the person, the subject, the object)

### *During the exam: Listen to the audio in 2 rounds*

1. First round: Focus on the overall meaning. At this stage you can answer a few general questions.  
2. Second round: Listen more carefully, and answer all remaining questions. This is where you focus on specific information required by the questions. Listen for keywords identified before the exam. Pay attention to:  
   1. *Connectors:* (e.g., 但是 'dànshì' - but, 因为 'yīnwèi' - because, 所以 'suǒyǐ' - so)   
   2. *Implied Meaning:* Although very rare, sometimes you need to infer what the speaker means even if it's not explicitly stated.

### *After finishing the questions: Proofread*

1. For each answer you wrote, look for that part in the audio and listen to it again so your answer is reinforced.  
2. You can give a small tick near each question to mark them for each proofreading.  
3. Proofread at least 3 times (3 ticks per question).
