## 2.2 Reading Strategy

### *Skim and Scan*

1. Scan the overall paragraph briefly first, so you can obtain a general idea of the main topic and the summary of each sentence in your brain.  
2. Then, highlight key words in each question.  
3. Return to the text to scan for key words. Read that sentence and answer the question based on it.

### *After finishing the questions: Proofread*

1. For each answer you wrote, look for that part in the paragraph and listen to it again so your answer is reinforced.  
2. You can give a small tick near each question to mark them for each proofreading.  
3. Proofread at least 3 times (3 ticks per question).
