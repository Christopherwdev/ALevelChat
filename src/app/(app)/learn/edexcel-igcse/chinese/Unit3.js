# Unit 3: Writing

## 3.1 Writing Task 1: Details

You are given 4 Chinese keywords. You are required to write a paragraph of 60-75 words based on a topic, using all 4 keywords.   
If you are a competent native writer, the emphasis to achieve even higher marks is on creativity, fluency, and sophisticated language use.

## 3.2 Writing Task 1: Strategy

### *Planning before you start writing*

1. Write a point form outline of your paragraph on a blank space.  
2. Brainstorm the content of your paragraph in bullet point, and how each keyword can be used.  
3. Think of ways to expand the keywords, not just mentioning them without showing what they mean.

### *During writing*

1. Logical arrangement: Arrange your paragraph into a logical sequence, with identifier words. Choose one of the following:  
   1. Chronological order: 首先，然後，此外，最後  
   2. Cause-and-effect: 因為，由於，所以，此外，結果  
2. Develop each keyword: Don’t just mention the keywords without showing what they mean. Expand on each keyword by applying them into content-rich sentences.  
   1. For example, if a keyword is "旅行" (travel), don't just say "我去旅行" (I went travel). Elaborate: "去年暑假，我到了风景如画的云南去旅行，飽覽了當地的景色和菜餚。"  
3. Advanced Language use: Use complex sentence structures and vocabulary to enhance your paragraph, while making sure they are used appropriately (or else it will backfire).  
   1. 4-character phrases: 風景如畫，名盛一時，etc.  
   2. Subordinate clauses: 雖然...但是，如果...就，etc.

### *After finishing the paragraph: Proofread*

   1. Check if it is natural and fluent.  
   2. Check if it is answering the question, not off-topic.  
   3. Check if all 4 keywords are being used and expanded.  
   4. Check if the phrases and sentence structures are used appropriately.  
   5. Check if your paragraph is within the 60-75 word limit.
