# Unit 5: Speaking

## 4.1 Speaking Task 1: Details

You are required to choose a picture and answer the examiner’s questions based on it by speaking Chinese.

The examiner will ask the following questions exactly once:

**Question type 1:** A description of what you can see in the picture

**Question type 2:** Specific factual information about the picture 

- For example, “what is the person in the picture doing?”

**Question type 3:** Past or future hypothesis 

- For example, “what happened before that leads to the picture?”, “what do you think is going to happen?”

**Question type 4:** Opinions about the picture 

- For example, “do you agree or disagree with what the person is doing?”

**Question type 5:** Evaluation 

- The teacher/examiner should elicit an evaluation from the student. This question will move away from the content of the picture and exploit the wider topic area.  
- For example, “do you think school life should have a lot of pressure?” if your picture is about education.
