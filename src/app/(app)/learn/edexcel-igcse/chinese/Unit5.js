# Unit 5: Physics from Creation to Collapse  

## 12. Heat and gases

### Temperature and pressure

- As temperature rises, average molecular KE rises  
- \<c2\> and momentum rises  
- Change of momentum of molecules with walls rises  
- Rate of collision of molecules with walls rises  
- So Rate of change of momentum rises  
- So F rises and by P=F/A, p rises

### Microwave principle

- Rotating water molecules collide with food molecules  
- Transfer of KE  
- Average molecular KE and internal KE rises so temperature rises

### Why ice worse than water in microwave

- **Ice is a solid so molecules in fixed positions**  
- **So molecules can’t rotate**

## 13. Simple harmonic motion

### SHM definition

- Force/acceleration directly proportional to displacement **from equilibrium position**  
- Always towards equilibrium position

### Measuring T

- Use **marker** at equilibrium position  
- As moving fastest so %U is least  
- Measure 30 oscillations  
- Time duration rises so %U lowers  
- Repeat timing and calculate mean  
- Swing a few times before measuring  
- As first oscillation affected by force

### Why equilibrium position

- Mass moving fastest  
- So period more precise  
- %U is least  
- Center is fixed but amplitude lowers over time  
- Because there is damping  
- So mass may not pass other points

### Damping

- **By frictional forces**  
- Dissipates energy  
- Prevents rise in amplitude  
- Which would damage the structure  
- So oscillation dies out quickly

### Dampers

- Energy transferred from bridge to damper  
- Energy dissipated in dampers  
- So bridge amplitude is small

### Plastic damping

- Changes shape and absorbs energy  
- Doesn’t return to original shape  
- Energy dissipated

### Why large mass for pendulum

- Damping  
- If m large, less deceleration by F \= ma  
- Speed lowers less

### Resonance

- When a system is forced to oscillate at natural frequency  
- Max transfer of energy  
- Raises amplitude to maximum

### Resonance example

- Vibration of air in musical instrument  
- Occurs at particular frequency related to size of resonating cavity  
- So musical sounds produced

### Induced pendulum

- Forced oscillation on B  
- A and B same oscillation f as same length  
- If driving frequency \= oscillation frequency, resonance occurs  
- Max energy transfer  
- B also acts as driver on A  
- If length not equal, driving frequency \=/= oscillation frequency, little energy transfer

### Woodboxes

- Speaker drives wood to oscillate  
- So wood drives larger volume of air to oscillate

### Why lose contact

- Acceleration always towards equilibrium position  
- W \- R \= ma  
- If a \>= g, R \= 0 so lose contact

## 14. Radioactivity

### Radioactive atom definition

- An atom with an unstable nucleus  
- Which emits a, B or y radiation

### Spontaneous definition

- Decay happens without any external stimulus.  
- Decay unaffected by external factors

### Random definition

- Can’t identify which nucleus will be next to decay  
- Can’t say when a nucleus will decay

### Why is radioactive count repeated

- **Random process**  
- Repeating enables mean to be calculated

### Nuclear binding energy

- The energy equivalent to **mass deficit**  
- When nucleons bind to form atomic nucleus

### Why is energy released

- Nucleus splits to form less massive nuclei  
- Binding energy per nucleon rises  
- As large no. of nucleons, much energy released

- **Total mass lowers**  
- E \= mc2, **where c is speed of light**  
- Mass energy conserved, so energy released  
- As c2 large, much energy released

### Fe

- Highest binding energy per nucleon  
- So most stable  
- Need most energy to break nucleus  
- Release most energy when nucleus forms  
- **Fission of more massive nuclei releases energy**  
- **Fusion of less massive nuclei releases energy**

### Why alpha larger KE than Np in decay

- Alpha smaller mass  
- Both same momentum  
- By KE \= p2/2m, alpha KE is larger

### Why alpha likely to be emitted in decay

- High binding energy per nucleon  
- So greatest energy released by nucleus

### Conditions for fusion

- 4 \+ 2  
- Requires high temperature  
- Nuclei positive charge so large repulsive force  
- At high temperature high KE to overcome repulsion  
- Nuclei must get close enough to fuse  
- Requires high density  
- Collision rate high enough to sustain fusion

- **Reference to extreme conditions leading to containment problems**

### Criticise count rate experiments

- Count rate \=/= activity  
- Counts not corrected for background  
- GM tube too far from source  
- Alpha particles won’t reach GM tube as short range in air  
- Radiation spreads out from the source, so not all reach the GM tube  
- GM tube won’t detect all gammas which enter it

- Alpha particles could have been absorbed by the glass  
- Alpha particles will be emitted in all directions  
- Alpha particles could have come from other parts of the vase  
- **The decay products can also emit radiation**

### Why choose long half life for testing

- **Activity** doesn’t change significantly over time

### Radioisotope sterilisation

- Alpha unsuitable as strongly ionising so won’t pass through packaging  
- Beta unsuitable as moderately ionising so won’t pass through metal  
- Gamma suitable as penetrate packaging and metal  
- Gamma weakly ionising so strong source needed to ensure sterilisation

### Why bags are safe to contain alpha radionuclides

- Alpha won’t penetrate the bag so gas can’t escape  
- Alpha won’t penetrate the bag so no risk

### Why alpha particles only dangerous when ingested

- Alpha particles very ionising  
- So low penetrating power

### Why gamma is dangerous when exposed externally

- Gamma very penetrating

### Radionuclide safety precaution

1. Make source at least 30 cm from body  
2. Make source pointed away to minimize exposure  
3. Use one source at a time to minimize exposure  
- The source emits ionising radiation which is harmful to cells  
- Ionising effect is cumulative

- **Handled using long tongs**  
- **As intensity inversely proportional to distance**  
- **Keep in lead-lined box**

### Why radioactive decay lowers exponentially

- **Fixed probability λ** for a nucleus having decay  
- For a sample with many unstable nuclei there is a predictable pattern  
- Fraction of nuclei decaying is equal to **decay constant λ**  
- A \= λN  
- N \=  N0e\-λt, the number of unstable nuclei lowers exponentially  
- So A \= A0e\-λt

### Fusion difficulties

- Little possibility of a runaway fusion reaction  
- Hydrogen abundant, fuel for fission limited  
- Less radioactive waste produced from fusion process  
- High temperature needed  
- Plasma must not touch reactor walls, so strong magnetic fields needed  
- If plasma touches walls **the temperature falls**

### Why need concrete walls

- Decay products are radioactive  
- Neutron can only be stopped by large thickness of concrete

## 15. Astronomy

### Parallax method

- Star viewed from 2 positions at 6 months intervals  
- Measure change in angular position against backdrop of fixed stars  
- Trigonometry used to calculate d  
- **The diameter of Earth’s orbit around the sun must be known**

### Standard candle

- A standard candle is identified in galaxy  
- Radiation flux received on Earth is measured  
- Inverse square law to determine distance using luminosity of candle  
- F \= L/4πd2

### Hubble constant

- Frequency of line in spectrum measured  
- Determine difference in frequency with same line in lab source  
- ∆λ/λ \= v/c to calculate v  
- Hubble’s law used to determine distance

### Velocity radius curve

- V2 \= M/r  
- Dark matter raises M  
- If M rises r rises then v may be constant

### Doppler shift

- Fractional change in λ due to relative motion between source and observer  
- λ by star compared to λ in lab  
- ∆λ/λ \= v/c to calculate v  
- λ rises if star receding

### Range of wavelength

- Doppler shift  
- **Moving both away and towards**  
- If moving away then λ rises  
- Have range of v so range of λ

### Why smaller stars harder to detect

- Smaller gravitational force  
- Orbit radius lowers  
- So change in λ smaller and undetectable

### How dark matter determines universe fate

- **Dark matter raises mass**  
- Dark matter raises density  
- Fate of universe depends on density  
- If density \> critical then universe reaches maximum size and contracts

### Why universe expanding

- Red shift in all distant galaxies  
- Shift rises as distance rises  
- All galaxies moving away from each other

### Why universe not expanding

- More distant galaxies seen in their past  
- Photons less energetic in the past  
- So frequency less by distant galaxies

### Main sequence definition

- A star fusing Hydrogen in its **core**  
- Constant luminosity

### White dwarf definition

- Small surface area so dwarf  
- High temperature and emit all λ so white

### Why more massive star higher luminosity

- More **gravitational force**  
- The **core** has higher density and temperature  
- Fusion occurs much faster  
- Surface temperature is greatest  
- Surface area is greatest  
- So by Stefan’s law, L is greatest

### Why more massive star less time in main sequence

- More **gravitational force**  
- The **core** has higher density and temperature  
- Fusion occurs much faster  
- Hydrogen used up much faster  
- So shorter main sequence lifetime

### Red giant formation

- The core runs out of Hydrogen  
- Core temperature falls  
- Gravitation forces cause the core to contract releasing energy  
- So core temperature rises  
- Helium fuses to heavier elements  
- Star expands and surface temperature falls forming red giant
