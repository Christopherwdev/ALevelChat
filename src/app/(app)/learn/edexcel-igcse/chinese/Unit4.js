# Unit 4: Translating

You are required to translate English sentences into Chinese.  
The first few questions are 2 marks, and the last few questions 3 marks, requiring you to translate linguistic structures and vocabulary accurately.  
It is also easy to miss out some minor words, such as 我的 (my), 是 (is), etc. So make sure to apply the following strategy to eliminate any possibilities of errors.

## Translating Strategy

Translate the sentence word by word.

1. Break down the English sentence into individual words with “/”.  
2. For each word, write its Chinese counterpart. Do not care about linguistic meanings and fluency first. Do not miss any word from the original sentence, even if you think it doesn’t matter.  
3. Combine the Chinese words into a sentence, and reorder/modify some words to make sure the sentence is natural.

After finishing the sentence: Proofread

5. Read the sentence in your brain a few times.   
   1. Check if it is natural and fluent.  
   2. Check if every word in the English sentence is mentioned.  
   3. Check if the linguistic meaning of the English sentence is maintained in the Chinese sentence.  
6. Proofread at least 3 times.
