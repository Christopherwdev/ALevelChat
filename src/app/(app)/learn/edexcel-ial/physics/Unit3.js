# Unit 3: Practical Skills in Physics I  

## A. Basic Definitions

Error: the difference between measured value and the actual value   
Uncertainty: the range in which the true value is considered to lie  
Accuracy: the closeness of measured value to the actual value  
Precision: the consistency / spread of values obtained by repeated measurements 

### Random error: anomalies in the values 

- Repeat and mean to give a more accurate value  
- Parallax error   
- Human reaction time   
- Overtightening of micrometre / vernier calliper

### Systematic error: faulty instruments or flaws in experimental method 

- All readings differ from the actual value by a fixed amount / affect accuracy of all readings to the same extent  
- Zero error (of instruments)   
- Missed out quantities   
- Contact resistance between contact surfaces   
- Reversed polarity / connection in a circuit   
- Colour filters do not give monochromatic light 

## B. Common Points

### Criticise the recording of results in a table

1. Inconsistent d.p. / s.f.   
2. Missing units   
3. No signs of repeat and mean   
4. Data range (of independent variable) is too small  
5. Too few readings   
6. Inconsistent interval between readings (of independent variable)  
7. Methodology: should have timed more than one oscillation and average

### Accurate measurement 

1. Clamp to fix the position of the metre rule   
2. Use a set square to ensure the metre rule is perfectly vertical / horizontal   
3. Put the metre rule closely next to the object / Attach a marker to the spring  
4. Use a set square to take perpendicular reading to the scale to avoid parallax error  
5. Check zero error (systematic error)   
- ensure the zero on the metre rule is aligned with the floor)   
- ensure reading of ohmmeter is 0 when the switch is open  
- zero the electronic balance every time before measurement   
6. Choose better instrument   
     
High-speed video camera \> stopwatch  
- allow rewind / repeated readings  
- can play frame by frame / count the number of frames  
- eliminate human reaction time  
  Light gate connected to a data logger \> stopwatch   
- eliminate human reaction time / reduce random error  
- high sampling rate  
- reduce % uncertainty  
  Digital voltmeter   
- higher resolution / reduce % uncertainty  
- avoid parallax error / reduce random error   
- does not require interpolation of values  
  Ohmmeter \> voltmeter & ammeter   
- give a value of resistance without further calculation  
- lower uncertainties by reading from one device   
- no need for additional power supply  
    
7. Ensure correct connection (polarity / ammeter in series / voltmeter in parallel) 

8. Repeat the measurement at different positions AND orientations, then calculate a mean (random error)   
9. Micrometre: use ratchet to close up the micrometre to avoid overtightening / Vernier calliper: do not use excessive force when tightening the jaws → which will deform the object to be measured (random error) 

10. Control background information (random error)   
- Control temperature by water bath  
- Control light by performing in a dark room  
- Control sound level   
- Control current across a circuit (I↑ temp↑ R↑ ρ↑) 

### Safety precautions

1. Topple → use a heavy counterweight to avoid toppling / clamp the set up  
2. Fall → put a soft cushion below the masses / reduce height / keep feet out of fall zone  
3. Break / snap under high tension → wear safety goggles / be aware of sharp edges   
4. Brittle glass → (break / sharp edges could cause injury by cuts) wear protective gloves  
5. High temp → (risk of scalding / burns) wear protective gloves / clamp hot apparatus   
6. Short circuit → (electric shock from power supply / circuit damage / overheating) use a fixed resistor to protect the circuit by limiting the max. current / use lower voltage  
7. Loud sound → (damage hearing/ears) wear ear plugs / limit the volume and duration of exposure / do not stand too closely to the source of sound   
8. Laser → (high-frequency light may cause irritation to the eye) do not look directly at the beam / remove any reflective surface nearby / wear dark lens safety glasses

### Diffraction grating

- Grating is at right angle to the light from laser   
- Grating is parallel to the screen of projection  
- Use larger distance between the grating and screen to increase fringe separation   
- Measure distance between same-order maxima on both sides of the central maximum and divide by 2 to find a mean   
- Measure distance between the centres of maxima → consistent measurement

### Measuring volume of solid

- Use a measuring cylinder filled with water   
- Add 10 identical coins and measure the change in volume of water   
- Volume of displaced water divided by the number of coins  
- Coins added slowly to prevent splashing of water   
- Measuring cylinder read at eye level to avoid parallax error   
- Ensure the measuring cylinder is vertical

### Plotting graphs 

- More pairs of values used   
- Drawing a best-fit line (where all the points lie on) act as an averaging method  
- Easy to identify anomalous values   
- Identify any systematic error (check if y-intercept is 0 for directly proportional relationship)
