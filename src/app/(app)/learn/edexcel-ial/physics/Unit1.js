# Unit 1: Physics on the Go  

## 1. Measurement and Units
- SI Units: The International System of Units (SI) includes:
- Length: Meter (m)
- Mass: Kilogram (kg)
- Time: Second (s)
- Electric Current: Ampere (A)
- Temperature: Kelvin (K)
- Amount of Substance: Mole (mol)
- Luminous Intensity: Candela (cd)
- Significant Figures:
- Rules include: all non-zero digits are significant, zeros between significant digits are significant, leading zeros are not significant, and trailing zeros in a decimal are significant.
- Importance: Reflects precision in measurements.
- Errors in Measurement:
- Systematic Errors: Consistent offsets (e.g., a scale that is always 0.5 kg off).
- Random Errors: Fluctuations in measurements due to unpredictable variables.
- Ways to minimize: Calibration, repeated measurements, and statistical analysis.
## 2. Kinematics
- Motion:
- Distance vs. Displacement: Distance is scalar (total path length); displacement is vector (shortest path between start and end).
- Speed vs. Velocity: Speed is scalar (magnitude only); velocity includes direction.
- Graphs of Motion:
- Distance-Time Graphs: Slope = speed; horizontal line indicates stationary.
- Velocity-Time Graphs: Slope = acceleration; area under the graph = distance traveled.
- Equations of Motion:
- For uniformly accelerated motion:
- v=u+at
- s = ut + 1/2at^2
- v^2 = u^2 + 2as
## 3. Dynamics
- Newton's Laws of Motion:
- First Law: An object at rest stays at rest; an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net force.
- Second Law: F=maF = maF=ma (force equals mass times acceleration).
- Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- Forces:
- Types: gravitational (weight), normal (support force), frictional (opposes motion), tension (in strings), etc.
- Free-body Diagrams: Visual representation of all forces acting on an object.
- Friction:
- Depends on the nature of surfaces and normal force.
- Static vs. kinetic friction: static friction prevents motion, while kinetic friction acts during motion.
## 4. Energy and Work
- Work Done:
- Defined as W=Fdcos⁡(θ)W = Fd\cos(\theta)W=Fdcos(θ), where FFF is force and ddd is displacement.
- Units: Joules (J).
- Kinetic and Potential Energy:
- Kinetic Energy: KE=12mv2KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2KE=21​mv2.
- Gravitational Potential Energy: PE=mghPE = mghPE=mgh (where hhh is height).
- Power:
- Defined as the rate of doing work: P=WtP = \frac{W}{t}P=tW​.
- Units: Watts (W), where 1 W = 1 J/s.
## 5. Momentum
- Definition of Momentum:
- p=mvp = mvp=mv (momentum = mass × velocity).
- Momentum is a vector quantity.
- Conservation of Momentum:
- In a closed system, total momentum before an event (collision or explosion) equals total momentum after.
- Applications: Analyze collisions using conservation laws, distinguishing between elastic and inelastic collisions.
