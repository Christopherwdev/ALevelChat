## 6. Waves
### Principle of Superposition of Two Waves
- When two waves meet, the resultant displacement is the sum of the individual displacements
### Standing Wave
- A standing wave confines energy instead of transferring it
- It has a stable, stationary wave pattern with nodes and antinodes
### Production of a Standing Wave
- A wave meets its reflection with identical frequency and amplitude, traveling in the opposite direction
- Superposition occurs, creating antinodes (maximum amplitude, constructive interference) and nodes (zero amplitude, destructive interference)
### Antiphase
- Two waves in antiphase have a constant phase difference of 180°
### Destructive Interference
- Cancellation of two waves with identical frequency and amplitude but in antiphase, resulting in zero amplitude
### Amplitude at Point A
- The provided equation p d λ = n(+ 1/2) is incomplete and needs context to determine if the waves are in phase or antiphase at point A, and therefore whether the amplitude is high or low
### Increased Frequency of a Standing Wave
- Stationary waves only occur at specific frequencies
- Increasing frequency while keeping velocity constant decreases wavelength (v = fλ)
- Since length remains constant (L = nλ), the number of complete wave cycles increases
- Amplitude may decrease along the standing wave
- The number of nodes equals the number of antinodes plus one
### Undisturbed Standing Wave Pattern at Node
- A node has zero amplitude
- No energy is absorbed when the node is touched
### Polarized vs Unpolarized Light
Similarities:
- Direction of oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of propagation
Differences:
- Unpolarized light oscillates in many directions
- Polarized light oscillates in a single direction
### Testing for Plane Polarized Light
- Place a polaroid sheet between the light source and the observer and rotate it
- If all waves are blocked at a specific angle, the light is plane polarized
- Observation of two images, with only one remaining visible when a polaroid sheet is used, indicates plane polarized light
### Rotating Polaroid Sheet and Two Images
- Only components of oscillations parallel to the plane of polarization are transmitted
- Rays for each image oscillate in directions differing by 90°
- Rotating the polaroid sheet causes one image to fade while the other becomes visible
- At angles of (180n + 90)°, one image disappears, and the other is brightest
- At angles of (180n)°, the original image is visible
### Sunglasses and Underwater Visibility
- Reflected light is partially plane polarized and can be blocked by a polarizing filter at a right angle
- Refracted light is unpolarized and less affected
### Double Slit Experiment with Polaroids
- The screen is illuminated evenly, and dark fringes are absent because the oscillations from the two polaroids are perpendicular and do not interfere
### Diffraction
- The spreading out of a wave as it passes around an obstacle
### Diffraction Pattern and Wave Theory
- The diffraction pattern arises from interference
- Slits act as coherent wave sources
- Diffracted waves superpose, producing bright fringes (constructive interference) and dark fringes (destructive interference)
### Determining Wavelength in Diffraction Experiment
1.	Measure the distance (D) between the grating and the wall
2.	Measure the distance (x) between the central and first-order fringe
3.	Calculate the angle of diffraction (θ) using tan θ = x/D
4.	Determine the grating separation (d) from the number of lines per meter on the grating
5.	Calculate the wavelength (λ) using d sin θ = nλ, where n = 1
6.	Accuracy increases with smaller grating separation and larger fringe separation
### Changes in Diffraction Pattern
- Longer wavelength: Fringe separation increases
- Narrower slit separation: Fringe separation increases; light intensity decreases
### Monochromatic and Coherent Light
- Monochromatic light: Contains only a single wavelength
- Coherent light: Waves have a constant phase relationship
### Requirements for Coherent Light Sources
- Same frequency
- Constant phase difference
### Disadvantage of Large-Scale Divisions
- Reduced precision and accuracy of measurement
### Light wave
- Light is electromagnetic wave
- Oscillation of electric and magnetic fields
- Oscillation direction of particles is perpendicular to the direction of wave travel and energy transfer
### Wavefront
- A line in which all the points are in phase
### Huygen’s construction
- Each point on the wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets

### Why diffraction experiment is accepted by the scientific community
- Provides experimental evidence
- Supports previous evidence
- Result is reproducible by others
### Pulse echo technique
- Ultrasound emitted in pulses
- Ultrasound reflected at the boundary of object due to change in density
- Time of receiving reflected pulse measured
- Calculate speed x distance
- Speed of ultrasound used
- Measured time divided by 2
### Why ultrasound is worse than laser in detecting moving objects
- Ultrasound has lower speed
- Reflected pulse received after longer time
- Longer reaction time
### Why ultrasound is worse than laser in detecting distant objects
- Ultrasound has longer wavelength
- Less detail and resolution
- Reflection not detected
- Waves diffract
- Intensity lowers over distance
- Energy lost in atmosphere and reflection
### Why use data logger
- Measure two variables at the same time
- Measure more readings at the same time
- Measure readings continuously
- No parallax error
- Lower resolution so smaller %U
- If computer, can plot graph of results
- Can measure readings over a short period of time
- Can measure readings over a long period of time
- Data logger can store and process results
### NTC thermistor
-        [1] Increase in pd increases energy transfer to ions  
-        [1] Ions release more charge carriers  
-        [2] As current rises, temperature rises  
-        [2] Electrons have more energy so more conducting electrons  
-        By I=nAVq, I increases  
-        By V=IR, R decreases
### Photon
- A packet of energy
- Electromagnetic radiation
### Emission Spectrum
- Electron exist in discrete energy level in atom
- Electron excited and return to original energy level and emit energy in one photon
- Energy of photon emitted is difference in energy levels
- E2 – E1 = hf, so frequency and wavelength of photon is proportional to difference in energy levels
- Certain energy level jumps are possible, so only photons with certain frequency are emitted
- Different elements have different energy levels and hence different wavelength of photon
- Each wavelength corresponds to a specific difference in energy level
### Absorption Spectrum
- Electron exist in discrete energy level in atom
- Electron excited by absorbing one photon
- One photon absorbed by one electron
- Energy of photon absorbed is difference in energy levels
- E2 – E1 = hf, so frequency and wavelength of photon is proportional to difference in energy levels
- Certain energy level jumps are possible, so only photons with certain frequency are absorbed
- Different elements have different energy levels and hence different wavelength of photon
- Each wavelength corresponds to a specific difference in energy level
### Why Absorption Spectrum is possible
- Light of the wavelength is absorbed by atom
- Absorbed radiation is reemitted in all directions
## 7. Circuits
### When current rises, temperature of metals rises
- Drift velocity rises (as electron gains KE from electric field)
- More frequent collisions of electrons and lattice ions
- KE transferred from electrons to lattice ions
- Lattice ions vibrate more so temperature rises
### When temperature rises, resistance of metals rises
- Lattice ions vibrate more
- More frequent collisions of electrons and lattice ions
- Drift velocity lowers
- By I=nAvq, as v lowers, current lowers
- By V=IR, resistance rises
### When temperature rises, resistance of thermistor lowers
- Atoms gain more thermal energy and vibrate more
- They release more conduction electrons by vibration
- By I=nAvq, as n rises, current rises
- By V=IR, resistance lowers
### When light intensity rises, resistance of LDR lowers
- Electrons gain more energy from light
- More conduction electrons released
- By I=nAvq, as n rises, current rises
- By V=IR, resistance lowers
### Explain S-shape of the I-V graph for a filament bulb
- At low V, current rises proportionally to V, ohm’s law obeyed
- As V rises, the current heats up wire
- Temperature of wire rises, so resistance rises
- Rate of increase of current lowers
- Same from the curve in the negative quadrant
### Explain the advantage for a battery to have a low internal resistance
- By Vterminal = E - Ir, low internal resistance causes high terminal voltage
- As current flows through the battery, fewer lost volts across internal resistance
- Less energy loss within lower internal resistance, so higher energy/power output
- Internal resistance limits the current, so lowering will produce a higher current
### When current rises, Vterminal lowers
- Pd across internal resistance in battery rises
- By Vterminal = E - Ir, low internal resistance causes high terminal voltage
- More energy loss due to internal resistance
- Max current is when pd Across internal resistance = emf of battery

### Current and voltage conservation in a circuit
- Current is rate of flow of charge
- Current is the same at all points in a series circuit
- Current across a junction is the sum of current at all branches in a parallel circuit
- Pd is energy transferred per unit charge
- Pd is the same across components in a parallel circuit
- Pd is shared between components in series
## 8. Photoelectric Effect
### Photoelectric effect
- Photon cause electron to be emitted from surface of metal
- Energy is needed to remove electron from the surface
- Work function is the minimum energy for electron to escape surface
- E=hf, one photon transfers energy to one electron
- An electron can escape if E > work function
- KE can’t be greater than hf – work function
- As electron below the surface needs energy to get to the surface, KE is less than hf – work function
### Photocell
- Photon energy > work function, so electrons are emitted
- For positive pd the electrons accelerate towards other end of photocell
- For negative pd the electrons decelerate, they need KE to reach other end of photocell
- No electrons reach other end of photocell at stopping potential

### Work function
- The minimum energy needed for an electron to escape the surface, and be released
### Phototube principle
- One photon transfers energy to one electron
- E=hf
- If energy of electron is above the work function
- Electron is released as photoelectron and released
- Intensity determines no of photons
- Moving electrons produce a current

### Why reversing potential difference reduces current
- Some electrons have low KE and can’t reach the anode
### How experiments support photon theory
- Photoelectrons released instantaneously
- Photon theory, one photon transfers energy to one electron instantaneously
- Wave theory, wave is continuous and energy builds up, so have time delay
- Increasing f increases max KE but increasing intensity doesn’t
- Photon theory, E=hf
- Wave theory, max KE depends on intensity not f
- Increasing intensity increases no of photoelectrons per second
- Photon theory, one photon releases one electron
- Intensity determines no of photons
- Wave theory, no of photoelectrons per second depends on f not intensity
- No photoelectrons unless exceed threshold f
- Photon theory, E=hf
- If f too low then energy of photon < work function
- Electron is emitted only when energy of photon > work function
- Any photon energy above work function is gained as KE
- Wave theory, wave is continuous and will release photoelectron if enough energy absorbed
- Electrons have max KE
- Photon theory, max KE is hf – work function
- Wave theory, wave is continuous and electrons can gain energy gradually, so have no KE limit
